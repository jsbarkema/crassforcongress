			<p class="lead">The Valley needs a new generation of leaders. Steve believes that effective representation requires a perspective gained outside of the Washington D.C. bubble. To that end, he has spent his career acquiring the skills and experiences to be an effective leader. As a father of three, he wants to ensure all of our children have the same advantages that he had growing up in the Valley.</p>

		<h4>Early Life</h4>
		<p>Steve was born and raised in Merced, California. Steve is a graduate of Merced High School and Merced Community College. From there, he went on to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Political Science from the UC system and a Juris Doctorate from the University of San Diego, School of Law.  After law school, and while awaiting military orders, Steve accepted a position as a Deputy District Attorney for Merced County.</p>
		
		<h4>Military</h4>
		<p>Steve honed his ability as a problem solver during six years of service as an Officer in the United States Navy. After attending Justice School at Naval Station, Newport, Rhode Island, Steve began his work as a Judge Advocate at the Washington Navy Yard. Shortly after reporting for duty in Washington D.C., the September 11 attacks occurred. Like most Americans, this had a profound effect on Steve&rsquo;s outlook on the importance of service. In 2003, his unique skill set was sought out, and he was hand selected to be one of the first Judge Advocates to forward deploy with a SEAL Team to the Middle East. Steve accepted the challenge. In that role, he advised SEAL Team Two&rsquo;s Commander as they engaged in Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom. Steve provided advice on rules of engagement, unit discipline and laws of war. Steve traveled throughout the Middle East which included time in Northern and Southern Afghanistan, Southern Iraq, the Northern Arabian Gulf, Kuwait and Bahrain. This experience allowed him to gain an invaluable perspective of the Middle East, the difficulties of armed conflict and the complexities of foreign policy. He earned a Navy Commendation Medal for his efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
		
		<h4>Law Enforcement</h4>
		<p>After leaving the Navy in 2006, Steve returned to the Valley as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of California which stretches from Bakersfield to Modesto. His case load focused on criminal immigration crimes. This experience shaped his views on crime and immigration in two important aspects. First, it demonstrated that a significant amount of Valley crime has its roots with violent international organized crime. All efforts need to be taken to ensure that narco-terrorism does not gain a firm foothold in the Valley and that starts with secure borders. Second, it demonstrated to him that a pragmatic solution must be sought to discern between the immigrant felons and those hardworking individuals that are simply looking to share in their own American dream. The Valley cannot afford, nor is it possible, to prosecute and deport its way to greater border security. Moreover, employers should not be required to act as the border patrol.</p>

	<div class="medium-6 large-6 columns">
		<h4>Business Advisor</h4>
		<p>Steve is currently an employment law attorney representing employers. As a trusted advisor, he is keenly aware of the problems facing Valley businesses. Utilizing problem solving techniques, common sense and a knowledge base gained through experience, he guides employers through today&rsquo;s web of complicated laws and regulations. He believes passing additional laws that make it more difficult for employers only cripples economic growth. As we all know, Central California is plagued by high unemployment. Merced County has the highest unemployment rate in the Valley. The government should be supporting businesses, not inhibiting economic growth.</p>
		<p>As a Valley resident, Steve has witnessed first-hand the successes and setbacks of friends and clients in the agricultural industry. The lack of water is an ever growing concern that has created an unstable future. All measures need to be taken to find a long term solution that increases the flow of water to Valley crops. A balance must be reached that takes into account the devastating economic affect that occurs when the government diverts water away from farming communities.</p>
		
		<h4>Education</h4>
		<p>Steve comes from a family of educators. His dad, Michael Crass, began his teaching career in 1968 at Frank Sparkes Elementary School in Winton, California before becoming the Assistant Superintendent for Merced Union High School District and ultimately returning as the superintendent for Winton Unified School District in 1994. Both of his sisters are high school teachers and his brother-in-law is a principal at Merced&rsquo;s Golden Valley High School. Of course, the most important educator in his life is his wife, Shannon. He believes the same entrepreneurial principles that are the backbone of the economy should be used in education. In other words, having one federally mandated top down approach stifles the ability of local leaders and educators to identify new, creative and innovative ways to learn.</p>	
		
		<h4>Team Crass</h4>
		<p>Steve is running because he believes that the next generation of representatives should focus on legislation and not the trappings of simply being a politician. Representation, by definition, cannot be done alone. By embracing our core Valley values, together we can make the Valley strong.</p>
